# AnalogJoystick.swift - Dynamic Display

This an implementation of AnalogJoystick that seperates the joysticks into the left and right areas of the screen. The joysticks will also dynamcially display at touch location and remain visible until touchesEnded. 

This implementation is incomplete and intended as a reference point only. For more information please see: https://github.com/MitrophD/Swift-SpriteKit-Analog-Stick
